2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_button_0 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_button_1 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_button_2 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_button_3 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on o_led_0 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on o_led_1 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on o_led_2 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on o_led_3 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of i_clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin inst_clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_wiz_0, clkfbout_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin inst_clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_clk_wiz_0, clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>
